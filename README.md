## üìù Overview

This project focuses on exploratory and automated testing of the login functionality at [http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login).  
The goal was to identify usability issues, validate expected behavior, and write automated tests using **Playwright with TypeScript**.

My approach included:
- Exploratory testing without formal requirements
- Designing manual test cases based on field behavior and UI responses
- Writing automated tests for both functional and non-functional scenarios
- Logging usability-related findings as defect reports

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Frameworks Used
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
- TypeScript
- Visual Studio Code
- Git Bash / Terminal
- Microsoft Edge (v138.0.3351.77)

---

## üöß Challenges Faced

- **Lack of UI labeling**: The login button appeared as a blank square, making it difficult to identify
- **No field guidance or feedback**: Fields were not highlighted or labeled after failed attempts
- **Input field clearing**: Overlength or incorrect input was erased after submission, causing friction
- **No clear test requirements**: Required building test logic purely from exploratory observation

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time Spent

- Test case design & exploratory testing: ~3 hours  
- Automated test writing: ~2 hours  
- Debugging, reporting, and documentation: ~1.5 hours  
- **Total:** ~6.5 hours

## ‚úÖ Recommendations for Further Testing

- Add accessibility tests (e.g., tab order, screen reader labels)
- Include cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Implement tests for login rate limits and brute-force protection
- Improve error messaging and field-level validation
- Add visual regression testing for UI elements
